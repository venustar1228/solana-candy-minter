Web application to mint tokens from a pre-generated Metaplex candy machine

## setup steps

1. Follow [these instructions](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1433816437525659658.html) until step 9.
2. With the candy machine created, you should grab its address.
3. Update the .env file with the candy machine address:

```
CANDY_MACHINE_ADDRESS=your_candy_machine_address_here
```

4. Deploy the application.
5. Test out your minting proccess. If you followed the steps correctly, you should be able to mint tokens
6. Spread the word and have success with your project =)

## development steps

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
